**Sample Essay**:
```
Technology has significantly transformed our daily lives in recent decades. While some argue that technology has complicated our existence, others believe it has simplified various aspects of life.

On one hand, technology has indeed made life more complex. The constant connectivity through smartphones and social media has created new pressures and expectations. People feel obligated to respond to messages immediately and maintain online presence, which can be stressful. Additionally, the rapid pace of technological change requires continuous learning and adaptation, which can be overwhelming for many individuals.

On the other hand, technology has undeniably simplified many tasks. Online shopping allows us to purchase goods without leaving home, saving time and effort. Communication has become instant and global, enabling us to connect with people worldwide effortlessly. Furthermore, digital tools have streamlined work processes, making many jobs more efficient.

In conclusion, while technology has introduced new complexities, its benefits in simplifying daily tasks and improving communication outweigh the challenges. The key is to use technology mindfully and adapt to its changes gradually.
