# EdPrep AI - Demo Guide

## 🎉 Your IELTS Writing Assessment Tool is Ready!

### What We've Built

You now have a fully functional AI-powered IELTS writing assessment prototype with:

✅ **Backend API** (FastAPI) - Running on http://localhost:8000  
✅ **Frontend Interface** (Next.js) - Running on http://localhost:3000  
✅ **Essay Scoring System** - Based on IELTS criteria  
✅ **Detailed Feedback Generation** - With improvement suggestions  
✅ **Sample Prompts** - Built-in IELTS practice topics  

### 🚀 How to Use Your System

#### Option 1: Use the Web Interface (Recommended)
1. Open your browser and go to **http://localhost:3000**
2. You'll see the EdPrep AI interface with:
   - Sample prompts to choose from
   - Essay submission form
   - Real-time results display

#### Option 2: Use the API Directly
Test the API with curl or any HTTP client:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/assess" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Some people think that technology has made our lives more complicated. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
    "essay": "Your essay text here...",
    "task_type": "Task 2"
  }'
```

### 📊 Scoring System

The system evaluates essays on 4 IELTS criteria:

1. **Task Achievement** (25%) - How well you address the prompt
2. **Coherence & Cohesion** (25%) - Organization and flow
3. **Lexical Resource** (25%) - Vocabulary range and accuracy  
4. **Grammatical Range** (25%) - Grammar variety and correctness

**Overall Band Score**: Average of the 4 criteria, rounded to nearest 0.5

### 🎯 Try These Sample Essays

#### Sample 1: Technology Essay
**Prompt**: "Some people think that technology has made our lives more complicated. To what extent do you agree or disagree?"

**Sample Essay**:
```
Technology has undoubtedly transformed our daily lives in numerous ways. While some argue that it has made life more complicated, I believe that technology has generally made our lives easier and more convenient.

Firstly, technology has simplified communication. We can now connect with people around the world instantly through social media and messaging apps. This has made it easier to maintain relationships and conduct business across borders.

Secondly, technology has made information more accessible. We can find answers to almost any question within seconds using search engines. This has revolutionized education and research.

However, it is true that technology can sometimes be overwhelming, especially for older generations who may struggle to keep up with constant updates. Additionally, the constant connectivity can lead to stress and reduced privacy.

In conclusion, while technology may present some challenges, its benefits far outweigh the complications it brings. The key is to use technology wisely and adapt to its changes.
```

#### Sample 2: Education Essay
**Prompt**: "Some people believe that students should study the science of food and how to prepare it. Others think that school time should be used for learning important subjects. Discuss both views and give your opinion."
